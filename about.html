<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p>Gender discrimination refers to the unfair treatment or prejudice against individuals based on their gender or sex.
     It occurs when individuals are treated differently, either directly or indirectly, because of their gender.
      This discrimination can manifest in various aspects of life, including employment, education, healthcare,
       social interactions, and legal rights.

    In many societies, gender discrimination primarily affects women and girls, although men and boys can also experience it in certain contexts. Common examples of gender discrimination include:
    
    <li>Unequal Pay: Women often receive lower wages compared to men for performing the same work or work of equal value.</li>
    
    
     <li>Limited Opportunities: Women may face barriers to accessing education, employment, promotions, or leadership positions solely because of their gender.</li>
    
    Gender discrimination undermines individuals' rights, dignity, and opportunities for personal and professional development.</p>
     Addressing gender discrimination requires challenging societal norms, promoting gender equality in laws and policies,
      fostering inclusive environments, and empowering individuals to challenge discriminatory practices.
